# qa-automation-journey
This project focuses on gaining and developing fundamental skills in QA Engineering and Automation

Aims:
- Gain understanding of QA Automation using Playwright for web based applications
- Gain a working knowledge of Postman for API testing and automation
- Gain a solid foundation in common development tools like SQL, XML, and Json 
- Write and test basic code, building on prior knowledge of JavaScript
- Building a solid QA Engineering and Automation foundation, in preparation for a working role

About me: 
Hello, I am Alex, currently a QA Analyst with a focus on manual testing and testing analysis. I am building this project to build on Automated testing principles in preparation for a QA Engineering role. 
I have been doing QA Testing/Analysis for 2 years, with a high focus on web based applications using JavaScript, Laravell, and C# to name some notable languages. 
My education was in Physics, and had a heavy empthasis on data collection, manipulation, and analysis. 

This project outline:
This project will use Playwright for test automation, covering UI automation, basic error handling, and testing + coding integration fundamentals to allow tests to continue in case of a 'failure' - some core fundamentals of QA Automation and Engineering

Playwright will use multiple browser support for testing, using some test websites to get the automated tests up and running for showcase. 

Later on I will cover Postman in more detail to test API's



Stack used in this project:
- JavaScript
- Playwright testing framework
- JSON and XML

// Will update this as my portfolio scales. 

Thankyou for reading.
